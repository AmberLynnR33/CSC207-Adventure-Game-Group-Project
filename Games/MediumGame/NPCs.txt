Hey there adventurer! It seems like you're trying to cross the chasm.
In nature's grasp, where giants sleep,
A rocky chasm, dark and deep.
To bridge the gap, a secret found,
A wand of wonder, strength unbound.

What am I? A rod so slight,
Yet magic dwells within its light.
Wave me high, the chasm clears,
The path revealed, conquer fears.

What am I that points the way?
A staff, a wand, come seize the day.
No mortal might, no bridge of stone,
But magic's touch to call your own.
