TAKEN KEYS

Hey there adventurer! Try exploring the grates and the caves down south.

VISITED ROOM 8
---
Hey there adventurer! Sure seems like a lamp would
help you explore the caves down there.

TAKEN LAMP

Hey adventurer! Have you heard of the glorious chamber of
orange stone far west of the canyons? That might be the best place to go.
I'm headed there soon so if you're around the area, stop by and say hi.
-
VISITED ROOM 15
---
Hi! You made it! This chamber was made in 1250 A.D. Have a look around.
Don't hesitate to ask me about the history of the building.
-
VISITED ROOM 21
---
Hey there adventurer! It seems like you're trying to cross the chasm.
Don't you remember the old hymn from the good 'ol days?
In nature's grasp, where giants sleep, A rocky chasm, dark and deep.
To bridge the gap, a secret found, A wand of wonder, strength unbound.

What am I? A rod so slight, Yet magic dwells within its light.
Wave me high, the chasm clears, The path revealed, conquer fears.
-
VISITED ROOM 24
---
Adventurer! It seems the trials and tribulations of the curtains
are stopping you. My spell book here says only the one with all of
the treasures of the earth and a source of life may pass. Good luck!
