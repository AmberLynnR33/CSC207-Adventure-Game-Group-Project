This is a group project for CSC207, Software Design, to learn software design practices while improving the accessibility of a text based adventure game and adding fun features. 

-- Permission from the instructor was granted to publicly share this project --

This final group project was intended to build off the work done on the previous assignments, by making a text-based adventure game more interactive and accessible. This project also gave us a chance to apply what we had learnt about design patterns and the agile process scrum.

During this project, we added the following features:

- Two new game modes: Curse of the Lost that randomizes movement, and Always Trolled that required winning a game against a troll to move rooms
- Two new object types: one that moves rooms when attempting to pick it up, and one that requires decoding a word to pick up
- Game statistics
- Ability to view the names of the rooms the player has visited overall, or a shortened list of rooms visited from the starting room
- NPCs that gives written and audible hints on what the player should do at critical points of the game
- Buttons corresponding to each possible direction the player can move to
- Ability to enlarge or shrink the room image to view
- Ability to traverse the main panel and most pop-up panels using the shift key, with alt text for screenreader support
